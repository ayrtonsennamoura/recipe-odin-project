      <h2>Recipe:</h2>
      
      <p>
        - 2 cups of rice
        - 500g of beef jerky, chopped into small pieces; <br>
        - 1 large onion, chopped; <br>
        - 3 cloves of garlic, minced; <br>
        - 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil;<br>
        - 2 teaspoons of salt;<br>
        - 1 teaspoon of black pepper;<br>
        - 1 teaspoon of cumin;<br>
        - 1 liter of water.<br>
      </p>
    
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>- In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until the onion is translucent.<br> 

          - Add the beef jerky to the pot, and stir until it is lightly browned.<br> 
          
          - Add the rice to the pot, and stir to combine with the beef jerky and onion mixture.<br> 
          
          - Add the salt, black pepper, and cumin to the pot, and stir to combine.<br> 
          
          - Add the water to the pot, and stir gently to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.<br> 
          
          - Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid. Simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed all of the liquid.<br> 
          
          - Once the rice is fully cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for about 5 minutes.<br> 
          
          - Remove the lid from the pot, and fluff the rice with a fork. Serve hot.<br>
