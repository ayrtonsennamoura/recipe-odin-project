      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>
          - Soak the black beans in water overnight or for at least 8 hours. Drain and rinse. <br>

          - In a large pot, cook the pork ribs, beef chuck, and pork shoulder over medium-high heat until browned on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside. <br>
          
          - Add the onions to the pot and cook until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. <br>
          
          - Return the meat to the pot and add the drained black beans, bay leaves, and enough water to cover everything. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the beans are tender and the meat is falling off the bone. <br>
          
          - Remove the meat from the pot and shred it, discarding any bones or excess fat. <br>
          
          - Cut the smoked sausage into slices and add it to the pot, along with the shredded meat. Cook for another 20 minutes. <br>
          
          - Season with salt and black pepper to taste. <br>
          
          - Serve the feijoada hot with farofa and white rice on the side.
